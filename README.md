# Image-Classification
Image Classification using Amazon Sagemaker

In this project, we trained and deploy an image classifier using Amazon Sagemaker. We used the image classification algorithm from Sagemaker to create, train and deploy a model that isbe able to classify 37 breeds of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.


In this project, we  focus on three learning objectives:<br>

1) Prepare data for Sagemaker Image Classifier <br>
2) Train a model using Sagemaker <br>
3) Deploy a model using Sagemaker <br>
